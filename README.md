### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The Browser Object Model, or BOM, is a JavaScript convention that specifies objects,
properties, and methods of the browser, as well as the relationship between these things.
2. The Document Object Model, or DOM, is contained within the BOM, and exists to represent
the contents of a document within a browser.
3. The DOM hierarchy depends on a document's contents, and each item within this hierarchy
or "tree" is known as a node. The most commonly used nodes are element, attribute, 
and text content nodes.
